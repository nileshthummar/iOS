##### RectangleKit


### RectangleKit Framework

## Input: List of zero or more rectangles, each rectangle has area greater than zero, each rectangle sits directly next to its neighbors on a common horizontal axis (i.e. there is no vertical gap between rectangles), and all rectangles sit flush on the common horizontal axis.

## Output: Shortest list of zero or more rectangle, each rectangle has area greater than zero, each rectangle sits directly on top of its neighbors (i.e. there is no horizontal gap between rectangles).  The output rectangles cover the same space as the input rectangles. By this we mean that the output rectangles have the same area as the input rectangles, and the silhouette / outline of the collection of output rectangles is the same as the silhouette / outline of the collection of input rectangle.
